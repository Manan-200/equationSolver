# Equation Solver
This app solves equations in one, two or three variables which have an integral solution.

## Usage
* Write number of variables of the equation(max:3) in the Variables textbox
* Write LHS(left hand side) of the equation in the LHS textbox
* Write RHS(right hand side) of the equation in the RHS textbox
* Choose a sort criteria (optional)

The app works on hit and trial logic.
The program puts random values into the equation and checks if LHS is equal to RHS.
Then the program inserts the values into the Listbox.
